Nvwa Agent - Deep Agent for distilling perspectives using nuwa-skill

This agent uses the deepagents library to create a powerful agent that can:
1. Distill perspectives from famous people using nuwa-skill
2. Answer questions from those perspectives
3. Manage files and execute commands as needed

The agent loads nuwa-skill through deepagents' skills system, which:
- Injects skill metadata into the system prompt
- Allows the agent to read full skill instructions via read_file
- Follows the progressive disclosure pattern

与 MADF 集成后：
- API key / base_url / model 从 backend.config.settings 读取
- root_dir 由调用方传入（每个生成任务独立工作目录 .gen_work/{skill_id}/）
- 去掉 LangSmith 等无关依赖，保持最小可用

**Critical**: You MUST read the extraction framework first by using read_file on 'references/extraction-framework.md' to understand the three-fold verification methodology.

Extraction steps:

1. **Mental Models Extraction (3-7 models)**
   - Scan all research files and list 15-30 candidate viewpoints
   - Apply three-fold verification to each candidate (see extraction-framework.md):
     * Cross-domain reproduction: Appears in ≥2 different domains/topics?
     * Generative power: Can predict this person's stance on new issues?
     * Exclusivity: Not how all smart people think?
   - Pass all 3 → Mental model; Pass 1-2 → Downgrade to decision heuristic; Pass 0 → Discard
   - Sort by exclusivity strength (more unique = higher priority), take top 3-7
   - Record format: name, one-line description, evidence sources (≥2 scenarios), application method, limitations

2. **Decision Heuristics Extraction (5-10 rules)**
   - Fast rules used for judgment, expressible as "if X, then Y"
   - Must have concrete case support

3. **Expression DNA Analysis**
   - Sentence preferences (long/short, question/statement, analogy density)
   - Vocabulary characteristics (high-frequency words, proprietary terms, taboo words)
   - Rhythm (conclusion-first or buildup-first, transition methods)
   - Humor style (sarcasm/self-deprecation/absurdism/deadpan/none)
   - Certainty expression ("I'm not sure" type vs "obviously" type)
   - Citation habits (who they quote, what types)

4. **Values and Anti-patterns**
   - Core values: 3-5 ranked priorities
   - Anti-patterns: Behaviors/thinking this person explicitly opposes
   - Contradictions and tensions: Internal conflicts between values (source of depth)

5. **Intellectual Genealogy**
   - Who influenced this person → Who they influenced → Position on the intellectual map

6. **Honest Boundaries**
   - Cannot predict reactions to entirely new problems
   - Cannot replace this person's creativity and intuition
   - Public expression vs true thoughts may differ
   - Information cutoff at research time

Output requirements:
- Write structured extraction results to a summary file
- For each mental model, include: name, evidence, application, limitations
- Preserve contradictions found in research - contradictions are valuable signals
- If information is insufficient (<10 usable sources), reduce mental models to 2-3 and expand honest boundaries section

Your task: Evaluate the SKILL.md structure across 8 dimensions and provide concrete improvement suggestions.

**Critical**: You will be given the path to the generated SKILL.md. You must:
1. Read the entire SKILL.md
2. Evaluate 8 structural dimensions:
   - Workflow clarity: Are steps clear and actionable?
   - Boundary conditions: Are edge cases and failure modes defined?
   - Checkpoint design: Are there clear decision points?
   - Instruction specificity: Are instructions concrete or vague?
   - Tool integration: Are tool calls well-specified?
   - Error handling: What happens when things go wrong?
   - Context requirements: What information is needed upfront?
   - Output format: Is expected output clearly defined?

3. Dry-run 3 typical test prompts mentally to evaluate:
   - Activation reliability: Does the skill trigger correctly?
   - Execution smoothness: Are there ambiguous steps?
   - Output quality: Does it produce useful results?

Output format:

Your task: Review activation conditions and role-playing operability to ensure real-world usability.

**Critical**: You will be given the path to the generated SKILL.md. You must:
1. Read the entire SKILL.md
2. Evaluate activation triggers:
   - Do they cover real usage scenarios?
   - Are they too narrow or too broad?
   - Are there missing trigger patterns?

3. Evaluate role-playing rules:
   - Are they actionable? (Do they tell the AI what to DO, not just what to BE?)
   - Is there problem routing? (What to do with different question types?)
   - Are there frequency constraints? (How often to use certain behaviors?)
   - Is there failure prevention? (What NOT to do?)

4. Identify missing critical information:
   - Context that should be provided upfront
   - Clarifications needed before execution
   - Dependencies not mentioned

Output format:

Activation Trigger Review:
- Current triggers: [List from frontmatter]
- Coverage assessment: [Do they match real usage?]
- Missing scenarios: [What's not covered]
- Suggested additions: [Specific trigger phrases to add]

Role-Playing Rules Review:
- Actionability: [Are rules concrete? Examples of vague vs clear]
- Problem routing: [Is there a decision tree for different inputs?]
- Frequency constraints: [Any behaviors that need limits?]
- Failure prevention: [What anti-patterns are defined?]
